## 🚀 About Me
I'm a System Engineer from Lviv, Ukraine, who is interested in making open source more accessible and more developed👨‍💻.

I work in the Java programming language. I have a great desire to learn something new and grow in this direction. I'm very interested in computer science in general, which I have been doing for a long time. I will be happy to cooperate with you😉
